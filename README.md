# Sylvie-Figura-Avatar
The public Minecraft avatar version of my OC Sylvie, made possible with the Figura mod!

Hi! Thanks for downloading my avatar, it's taken quite a bit of time and effort, so to see people enjoying it is always fun!

Now, to keep this fairly feature-packed avatar at least *somewhat* light on figura's avatar cloud, a lot of the clientside stuff that would otherwise take quite a bit of space have been put in a config file that the avatar has been bundled with.
Now, how do you set it up then? Well it's fairly easy. Just open the figura folder in your .minecraft folder, and look for a folder called "data". 
If you don't have it, copy the data folder from here and just paste it in there. If you already have one and have stuff in it, just take the .json file contained in said data file, and put it in the .minecraft > figura > data folder. 
Once you've done that, just throw the other folder into the figura > avatars folder, and it should be set up and ready to use! Feel free to do whatever with the stuff that's left. Either if you wanna keep this version around for some reason, or if you just wanna remove it now that it's set up, it's all up to you :3

If you encounter any problems with the setup, or have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, just reach out to me on the Figura Discord server, and I'd be happy to help ^^

Cheers!
